        <p>Doctor strange is my favorite character. I have whached every film that doctor strange has appeared. I like Doctor strange. First of all he is a avenger. Second that he know mistic arts. Third that he makes portals. Fourth he has the time stone. Fifth that he can see the future. Sixst he did a major roll in Avengers Endgame and finaly because he is one of the strongest Avenger. </p>
